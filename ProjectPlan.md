#Project Plan
This is the general project plan for ECE 582 Term Project written by Yang Liu.

##Goals

###Minimum Goal
The minimum goal for this term project is to build an application running on iOS device, like iPhone, to capture image from camera, or get image from album. Then detect faces in that image, use designed image processing way to generate new funny pictures. The first idea, for example, is to turn faces into zombie-like ones.

###Reasonable Goal
For reasonable goal, this program should be a complete app, which means that we should add more views, share, iAd or adMob, and rate functions to the app and publish it to iTunes app store.

###Ultimate Goal
Ulmately, this app should have more than one way make fancy images. Another way to be funny is switch or swap the faces in an image. More ways are to be designed to enrich this app.
